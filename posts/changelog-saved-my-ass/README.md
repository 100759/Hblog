## Cover

::: details *Log of the ship Susan*

The “Nantucket Sleigh Ride” pictured in the log of the ship Susan kept by Reuben Russell (1841–1846).

> The 19th-century whale hunt was a brutal business, awash with blubber, blood, and the cruel destruction of life. But between the frantic calls of “there she blows!”, there was plenty of time for creation too.
>
> From [*The Art of Whaling*](https://publicdomainreview.org/essay/the-art-of-whaling/) by [**Jessica Boyall**](https://publicdomainreview.org/contributors/#jessica-boyall)
